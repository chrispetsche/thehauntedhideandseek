                            the yard that's only accessible through the front door.

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>Naturally there can't be a game of hide and seek if there is no way of knowing what happens if someone gets tagged. Since 
                            the entire experience is unique, so why not the tag system?! And it designed and coded in C# to works like this...
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column text-portion left">
                        <p>Each player starts out with a tag token, if you will, except the seeker who has none. They carry these tokens until the seeker 
                            creeps up close enough to reach out and touch their target. As soon as they are tagged out, the hidder is teleported to a random 
                            room and the token is left where they were tagged. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In order for the seeker to count the tag, they MUST pick up the token!!

                    <div class="column text-portion right">
                        <p>The tagged hider does have a chance to gain back and even earn more tokens themselves. As a part of their 
                            defense/ handicap they are equipped with a flashlight, as mentioned. Even though the light can give away 
                            the hiders position in the dark house, the seeker is vulnerable to its glare.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>Should they get caught in the light, the system treats them as if they are a hider by teleporting them to a 
                            random respawn and a token is dropped. Like with seekers for token to count it MUST be picked up. But... 
                            hiders also have to reach the safe spot for it to lock in as a returned tag.
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>Now, if a hider is tagged without having a token the player is removed from the game until the round is over. 
                            If they still have a token when they reach the safe spot they are awarded another token. If they are carrying 
                            their token and stolen tokens, then they are awarded 1 token for their original plus 1 token for each one stolen. 
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The player with the least amount of tag tokens is automatically selected to be seeker in the next round. A round 
                            ends when time runs out or when the seeker has removed ALL hiders from the game. Rounds can vary in time.

                        <p>The seeker was designed to move with a gimp to create a handicap that gave the hiders an advantage. As a slight 
                            counter to that, I designed a simple teleportation system to help equal things up some.

                        <p>Inspired by creepy movies like "The Ring", it was settled that linking TVs throughout the house would be a fun 
                            way of going about this. I selected appropriate rooms to place the TVs in and coded them so that each one would 
                            teleport the seeker to a specific location the seeker would have to figure out as these locations changed every 
                            time a new game was loaded.

                            <p>The UI for this project was relatively easy to set up. It uses Unitys old NGUI system to create world space 
                                canvases that 2D sprites can be attached to. A collider system, using stationary cubes where the buttons are located 
                                and a single cube moved about by the XBox controller, allows players to interact with the elements and make 
                                their selections. There are 3 pages the player can select from:</p>
